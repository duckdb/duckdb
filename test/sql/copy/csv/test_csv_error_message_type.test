# Check our  possible solutions:
#* Override the type for this column manually by setting the type explicitly, e.g. types={'venueseats': 'VARCHAR'}
statement ok
INSERT INTO venue_2 SELECT * FROM read_csv('data/csv/venue_pipe_big.csv', sample_size = 1, types={'venueseats': 'VARCHAR'});

#* Set the sample size to a larger value to enable the auto-detection to scan more values, e.g. sample_size=-1
