# scalar HAVING queries
# constants only

# HAVING with column references does not work
# HAVING clause can only contain aggregates
statement error
SELECT a FROM test WHERE a=13 HAVING a > 11
----

# HAVING clause also turns the rest of the query into an aggregate
# thus column references in SELECT clause also produce errors

# once we produce a sum this works though
