# description: DISTINCT aggregations, without GROUP BY
# group: [ungrouped]

# Since these tests are made to test the ungrouped operator, and not necessarily the functions themselves
# This test will mostly focus on the order and mixing of distinct and non-distinct aggregates
# And not on variation between types and functions
