statement ok
create table test (id int, provider int, record_key int, record_rank int, record_date int)

# this subquery was fast, we select only record_key from it so it's equivalent to the next query
query II
explain select record_key from (
    select distinct on (id, provider) id, provider, record_key from test order by id, provider, record_rank desc, record_date
)

physical_plan	<REGEX>:.*HASH_GROUP_BY.*#0.*#1.*first\(#2, #3, #4\).*first\(#5, #6, #7\).*first\(#8, #9, #10\).*


# this query was slow, but should be equivalent to the first query
query II
explain select distinct on (id, provider) record_key from test order by id, provider, record_rank desc, record_date
----
physical_plan	<REGEX>:.*HASH_GROUP_BY.*#0.*#1.*first\(#2, #3, #4\).*first\(#5, #6, #7\).*first\(#8, #9, #10\).*

# the problem was that our aggregate became way too big in the second case because we didn't de-duplicate columns
# this regex checks that they both have the same 'minimal' aggregate (this test is a bit fragile to binder changes tho)
