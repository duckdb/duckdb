# For smaller block sizes, the total meta data size increases.
# On the GitHub runners, this test OOMs on the first query instead of the second.
# The memory usage and database size is around 7.4 GiB after table creation.
# In comparison, it is 3.2 GiB for the default block size.
# FIXME: Investigate why the database size is twice the size of the default block size.
