# name: test/sql/storage/commit_index_deletes.test
# description: Test commit of index with deletes
# group: [storage]

# FIXME: this test fails right now because deleted tuples are not correctly removed
# while checkpointing, which causes the start-up after checkpoint to fail during
# primary index construction. It should be re-enabled when deleted tuples are properly vacuumed.
