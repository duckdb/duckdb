# group: [transactions]

###
### The variation is that con1's query is now *also* in a transaction, we first commit the CREATE TABLE (con1's query)
###

load __TEST_DIR__/broken.db

statement ok
CREATE SCHEMA foo;

statement ok con2
START TRANSACTION;

# Drop the schema in con2
statement ok con2
DROP SCHEMA IF EXISTS foo CASCADE;

statement ok con1
START TRANSACTION

# Create a table on the schema we're dropping
# This should succeed because the schema drop isn't committed yet
statement ok con1
create table foo.bar as select 42;

# This passes because the 'drop schema' was not committed yet
statement ok con1
COMMIT;

# This fails because the create table introduces a new dependency
statement error con2
COMMIT;
