# For each incoming chunk, we add the row IDs to the delete index.
# For standard_vector_size = 2048, we delete the first chunk, and then try to insert the incremented values.
# This is expected to throw a constraint violation.
# The value going into the next chunk is not yet in the delete index, as the chunk that would add that value hasn't been processed, yet.
# This scenario is a known limitation (also in postgres).
