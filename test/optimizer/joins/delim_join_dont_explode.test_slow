# The query plan here used to join the two SEQ_SCANs first, and then join the DELIM_SCAN,
# Since PR #12290, we can reorder DELIM_SCANS
# Now the DELIM_SCAN is joined with a SEQ_SCAN first, and then with the SEQ_SCAN
# Now that we reorder semi joins the ordering of the sequential scans has also changed
