# Flummi recursive workloads

These workloads are adapted from the examples in
[Flummi](https://github.com/DBatUTuebingen/flummi) at commit
`5d979a526f65fcaf838003b5b7b5c189d35325f4`.

Flummi compiles imperative programs to SQL by representing control flow as a
recursive CTE. The generated query carries the program counter, control-flow
label, emitted values, and live program variables through the recursive state.
This exercises a different recursive plan shape from the algorithm-specific
`USING KEY` workloads elsewhere in this directory.

The adapted generated SQL is checked in under `queries/smoke` and
`queries/performance`, so running the DuckDB tests does not require the Flummi
compiler. The pinned upstream revision retains the original inputs. The
adaptations replace random inputs with deterministic data, reduce oversized
examples to CI-suitable scales, and return compact results suitable for answer
validation.

The ray-tracing benchmark retains shadows, reflection depth, and the original
spheres scene, but renders at 384 by 240 pixels instead of 3480 by 2160.
The Release benchmark validates the image length and checksum. The generated
ray query is intentionally not part of the RelDebug SQLLogicTest: binding and
optimizing its 5,800-line plan takes roughly two minutes even when the rendered
image is reduced further. The other selected programs have scaled correctness
coverage in `test/sql/cte/recursive_cte_flummi.test_slow`.
