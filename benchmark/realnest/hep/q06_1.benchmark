# name: benchmark/realnest/hep/q06_1.benchmark
# description: Q6-1 - For events with at least three jets, plot the 𝑝𝑇 of the trijet system four-momentum (i.e., any combination of three distinct jets within the same event) that has the invariant mass closest to 172.5 GeV in each event and plot the maximum b-tagging discriminant value among the jets in this trijet.
