# name: benchmark/realnest/hep/q08.benchmark
# description: Q8 - For events with at least three light leptons and a same-flavor opposite-charge light lepton pair, find such a pair that has the invariant mass closest to 91.2 GeV in each event and plot the transverse mass of the system, consisting of the missing transverse momentum and the highest-𝑝𝑇 light lepton not in this pair.
