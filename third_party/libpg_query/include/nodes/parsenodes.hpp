 * This is a byte (not character) offset in the original source text, to be
 * used for positioning an error cursor when there is an error related to
 * the node.  Access to the original source text is needed to make use of
 * the location.  At the topmost (statement) level, we also provide a
 * statement length, likewise measured in bytes, for convenience in
 * identifying statement boundaries in multi-statement source strings.

/*--------------------
 * PGRangeTblEntry -
 *	  A range table is a PGList of PGRangeTblEntry nodes.
 *
 *	  A range table entry may represent a plain relation, a sub-select in
 *	  FROM, or the result of a JOIN clause.  (Only explicit JOIN syntax
 *	  produces an RTE, not the implicit join resulting from multiple FROM
 *	  items.  This is because we only need the RTE to deal with SQL features
 *	  like outer joins and join-output-column aliasing.)  Other special
 *	  RTE types also exist, as indicated by RTEKind.
 *
 *	  Note that we consider PG_RTE_RELATION to cover anything that has a pg_class
 *	  entry.  relkind distinguishes the sub-cases.
 *
 *	  alias is an PGAlias node representing the AS alias-clause attached to the
 *	  FROM expression, or NULL if no clause.
 *
 *	  eref is the table reference name and column reference names (either
 *	  real or aliases).  Note that system columns (OID etc) are not included
 *	  in the column list.
 *	  eref->aliasname is required to be present, and should generally be used
 *	  to identify the RTE for error messages etc.
 *
 *	  In RELATION RTEs, the colnames in both alias and eref are indexed by
 *	  physical attribute number; this means there must be colname entries for
 *	  dropped columns.  When building an RTE we insert empty strings ("") for
 *	  dropped columns.  Note however that a stored rule may have nonempty
 *	  colnames for columns dropped since the rule was created (and for that
 *	  matter the colnames might be out of date due to column renamings).
 *	  The same comments apply to FUNCTION RTEs when a function's return type
 *	  is a named composite type.
 *
 *	  In JOIN RTEs, the colnames in both alias and eref are one-to-one with
 *	  joinaliasvars entries.  A JOIN RTE will omit columns of its inputs when
 *	  those columns are known to be dropped at parse time.  Again, however,
 *	  a stored rule might contain entries for columns dropped since the rule
 *	  was created.  (This is only possible for columns not actually referenced
 *	  in the rule.)  When loading a stored rule, we replace the joinaliasvars
 *	  items for any such columns with null pointers.  (We can't simply delete
 *	  them from the joinaliasvars list, because that would affect the attnums
 *	  of Vars referencing the rest of the list.)
 *
 *	  inh is true for relation references that should be expanded to include
 *	  inheritance children, if the rel has any.  This *must* be false for
 *	  RTEs other than PG_RTE_RELATION entries.
 *
 *	  inFromCl marks those range variables that are listed in the FROM clause.
 *	  It's false for RTEs that are added to a query behind the scenes, such
 *	  as the NEW and OLD variables for a rule, or the subqueries of a UNION.
 *	  This flag is not used anymore during parsing, since the parser now uses
 *	  a separate "namespace" data structure to control visibility, but it is
 *	  needed by ruleutils.c to determine whether RTEs should be shown in
 *	  decompiled queries.

 * PGSortGroupClause -
 *		representation of ORDER BY, GROUP BY, PARTITION BY,
 *		DISTINCT, DISTINCT ON items
 *
 * You might think that ORDER BY is only interested in defining ordering,
 * and GROUP/DISTINCT are only interested in defining equality.  However,
 * one way to implement grouping is to sort and then apply a "uniq"-like
 * filter.  So it's also interesting to keep track of possible sort operators
 * for GROUP/DISTINCT, and in particular to try to sort for the grouping
 * in a way that will also yield a requested ORDER BY ordering.  So we need
 * to be able to compare ORDER BY and GROUP/DISTINCT lists, which motivates
 * the decision to give them the same representation.
 *
 * tleSortGroupRef must match ressortgroupref of exactly one entry of the
 *		query's targetlist; that is the expression to be sorted or grouped by.
 * eqop is the OID of the equality operator.
 * sortop is the OID of the ordering operator (a "<" or ">" operator),
 *		or InvalidOid if not available.
 * nulls_first means about what you'd expect.  If sortop is InvalidOid
 *		then nulls_first is meaningless and should be set to false.
 * hashable is true if eqop is hashable (note this condition also depends
 *		on the datatype of the input expression).
 *
 * In an ORDER BY item, all fields must be valid.  (The eqop isn't essential
 * here, but it's cheap to get it along with the sortop, and requiring it
 * to be valid eases comparisons to grouping items.)  Note that this isn't
 * actually enough information to determine an ordering: if the sortop is
 * collation-sensitive, a collation OID is needed too.  We don't store the
 * collation in PGSortGroupClause because it's not available at the time the
 * parser builds the PGSortGroupClause; instead, consult the exposed collation
 * of the referenced targetlist expression to find out what it is.
 *
 * In a grouping item, eqop must be valid.  If the eqop is a btree equality
 * operator, then sortop should be set to a compatible ordering operator.
 * We prefer to set eqop/sortop/nulls_first to match any ORDER BY item that
 * the query presents for the same tlist item.  If there is none, we just
 * use the default ordering op for the datatype.
 *
 * If the tlist item's type has a hash opclass but no btree opclass, then
 * we will set eqop to the hash equality operator, sortop to InvalidOid,
 * and nulls_first to false.  A grouping item of this kind can only be
 * implemented by hashing, and of course it'll never match an ORDER BY item.
 *
 * The hashable flag is provided since we generally have the requisite
 * information readily available when the PGSortGroupClause is constructed,
 * and it's relatively expensive to get it again later.  Note there is no
 * need for a "sortable" flag since OidIsValid(sortop) serves the purpose.
 *
 * A query might have both ORDER BY and DISTINCT (or DISTINCT ON) clauses.
 * In SELECT DISTINCT, the distinctClause list is as long or longer than the
 * sortClause list, while in SELECT DISTINCT ON it's typically shorter.
 * The two lists must match up to the end of the shorter one --- the parser
 * rearranges the distinctClause if necessary to make this true.  (This
 * restriction ensures that only one sort step is needed to both satisfy the
 * ORDER BY and set up for the PGUnique step.  This is semantically necessary
 * for DISTINCT ON, and presents no real drawback for DISTINCT.)

 * PGGroupingSet -
 *		representation of CUBE, ROLLUP and GROUPING SETS clauses
 *
 * In a PGQuery with grouping sets, the groupClause contains a flat list of
 * PGSortGroupClause nodes for each distinct expression used.  The actual
 * structure of the GROUP BY clause is given by the groupingSets tree.
 *
 * In the raw parser output, PGGroupingSet nodes (of all types except SIMPLE
 * which is not used) are potentially mixed in with the expressions in the
 * groupClause of the SelectStmt.  (An expression can't contain a PGGroupingSet,
 * but a list may mix PGGroupingSet and expression nodes.)  At this stage, the
 * content of each node is a list of expressions, some of which may be RowExprs
 * which represent sublists rather than actual row constructors, and nested
 * PGGroupingSet nodes where legal in the grammar.  The structure directly
 * reflects the query syntax.
 *
 * In parse analysis, the transformed expressions are used to build the tlist
 * and groupClause list (of PGSortGroupClause nodes), and the groupingSets tree
 * is eventually reduced to a fixed format:
 *
 * EMPTY nodes represent (), and obviously have no content
 *
 * SIMPLE nodes represent a list of one or more expressions to be treated as an
 * atom by the enclosing structure; the content is an integer list of
 * ressortgroupref values (see PGSortGroupClause)
 *
 * CUBE and ROLLUP nodes contain a list of one or more SIMPLE nodes.
 *
 * SETS nodes contain a list of EMPTY, SIMPLE, CUBE or ROLLUP nodes, but after
 * parse analysis they cannot contain more SETS nodes; enough of the syntactic
 * transforms of the spec have been applied that we no longer have arbitrarily
 * deep nesting (though we still preserve the use of cube/rollup).
 *
 * Note that if the groupingSets tree contains no SIMPLE nodes (only EMPTY
 * nodes at the leaves), then the groupClause will be empty, but this is still
 * an aggregation query (similar to using aggs or HAVING without GROUP BY).
 *
 * As an example, the following clause:
 *
 * GROUP BY GROUPING SETS ((a,b), CUBE(c,(d,e)))
 *
 * looks like this after raw parsing:
 *
 * SETS( RowExpr(a,b) , CUBE( c, RowExpr(d,e) ) )
 *
 * and parse analysis converts it to:
 *
 * SETS( SIMPLE(1,2), CUBE( SIMPLE(3), SIMPLE(4,5) ) )

 * an executable expression tree), depending on how this PGConstraint
 * node was created (by parsing, or by inheritance from an existing
 * relation).  We should never have both in the same node!
 *
 * PG_FKCONSTR_ACTION_xxx values are stored into pg_constraint.confupdtype
 * and pg_constraint.confdeltype columns; PG_FKCONSTR_MATCH_xxx values are
 * stored into pg_constraint.confmatchtype.  Changing the code values may
 * require an initdb!
 *
 * If skip_validation is true then we skip checking that the existing rows
 * in the table satisfy the constraint, and just install the catalog entries
 * for the constraint.  A new FK constraint is marked as valid iff
 * initially_valid is true.  (Usually skip_validation and initially_valid
 * are inverses, but we can set both true if the table is known empty.)
 *
 * PGConstraint attributes (DEFERRABLE etc) are initially represented as
 * separate PGConstraint nodes for simplicity of parsing.  parse_utilcmd.c makes
 * a pass through the constraints list to insert the info into the appropriate
 * PGConstraint node.
