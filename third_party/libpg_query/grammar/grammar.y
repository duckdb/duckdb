/*
 * Non-keyword token types.  These are hard-wired into the "flex" lexer.
 * They must be listed first so that their numeric codes do not depend on
 * the set of keywords.  PL/pgSQL depends on this so that it can share the
 * same lexer.  If you add/change tokens here, fix PL/pgSQL to match!
 *
 * DOT_DOT is unused in the core SQL grammar, and so will always provoke
 * parse errors.  It is needed by PL/pgSQL.

/*
 * The grammar thinks these are keywords, but they are not in the kwlist.h
 * list and so can never be entered directly.  The filter in parser.c
 * creates these tokens when required (based on looking one token ahead).
 *
 * NOT_LA exists so that productions such as NOT LIKE can be given the same
 * precedence as LIKE; otherwise they'd effectively have the same precedence
 * as NOT, at least with respect to their left-hand subexpression.
 * NULLS_LA and WITH_LA are needed to make the grammar LALR(1).

 * To support target_el without AS, we must give IDENT an explicit priority

 * various unreserved keywords as needed to resolve ambiguities (this can't
 * have any bad effects since obviously the keywords will still behave the
 * same as if they weren't keywords).  We need to do this for PARTITION,
 * RANGE, ROWS to support opt_existing_window_name; and for RANGE, ROWS
 * so that they can follow a_expr without creating postfix-operator problems;
 * for GENERATED so that it can follow b_expr;
 * and for NULL so that it can follow b_expr in without creating
 * postfix-operator problems.
 *
 * To support CUBE and ROLLUP in GROUP BY without reserving them, we give them
 * an explicit priority lower than '(', so that a rule with CUBE '(' will shift
 * rather than reducing a conflicting rule that takes CUBE as a function name.
 * Using the same precedence as IDENT seems right for the reasons given above.
 *
 * The frame_bound productions UNBOUNDED PRECEDING and UNBOUNDED FOLLOWING
 * are even messier: since UNBOUNDED is an unreserved keyword (per spec!),
 * there is no principled way to distinguish these from the productions
 * a_expr PRECEDING/FOLLOWING.  We hack this up by giving UNBOUNDED slightly
 * lower precedence than PRECEDING and FOLLOWING.  At present this doesn't
 * appear to cause UNBOUNDED to be treated differently from other unreserved
 * keywords anywhere else in the grammar, but it's definitely risky.  We can
 * blame any funny behavior of UNBOUNDED on the SQL standard, though.
