 *
 * NOTE:
 *	This is a new (Feb. 05, 1999) implementation of the allocation set
 *	routines. AllocSet...() does not use OrderedSet...() any more.
 *	Instead it manages allocations in a block pool by itself, combining
 *	many small allocations in a few bigger blocks. AllocSetFree() normally
 *	doesn't free() memory really. It just add's the free'd area to some
 *	list for later reuse by AllocSetAlloc(). All memory blocks are free()'d
 *	at once on AllocSetReset(), which happens when the memory context gets
 *	destroyed.
 *				Jan Wieck
 *
 *	Performance improvement from Tom Lane, 8/99: for extremely large request
 *	sizes, we do want to be able to give the memory back to free() as soon
 *	as it is pfree()'d.  Otherwise we risk tying up a lot of memory in
 *	freelist entries that might never be usable.  This is specially needed
 *	when the caller is repeatedly repalloc()'ing a block bigger and bigger;
 *	the previous instances of the block were guaranteed to be wasted until
 *	AllocSetReset() under the old way.
 *
 *	Further improvement 12/00: as the code stood, request sizes in the
 *	midrange between "small" and "large" were handled very inefficiently,
 *	because any sufficiently large free chunk would be used to satisfy a
 *	request, even if it was much larger than necessary.  This led to more
 *	and more wasted space in allocated chunks over time.  To fix, get rid
 *	of the midrange behavior: we now handle only "small" power-of-2-size
 *	chunks as chunks.  Anything "large" is passed off to malloc().  Change
 *	the number of freelists to change the small/large boundary.
 *
 *
 *	About CLOBBER_FREED_MEMORY:
 *
 *	If this symbol is defined, all freed memory is overwritten with 0x7F's.
 *	This is useful for catching places that reference already-freed memory.
 *
 *	About MEMORY_CONTEXT_CHECKING:
 *
 *	Since we usually round request sizes up to the next power of 2, there
 *	is often some unused space immediately after a requested data area.
 *	Thus, if someone makes the common error of writing past what they've
 *	requested, the problem is likely to go unnoticed ... until the day when
 *	there *isn't* any wasted space, perhaps because of different memory
 *	alignment on a new platform, or some other effect.  To catch this sort
 *	of problem, the MEMORY_CONTEXT_CHECKING option stores 0x7E just beyond
 *	the requested space whenever the request is less than the actual chunk
 *	size, and verifies that the byte is undamaged when the chunk is freed.
 *
 *
 *	About USE_VALGRIND and Valgrind client requests:
 *
 *	Valgrind provides "client request" macros that exchange information with
 *	the host Valgrind (if any).  Under !USE_VALGRIND, memdebug.h stubs out
 *	currently-used macros.
 *
 *	When running under Valgrind, we want a NOACCESS memory region both before
 *	and after the allocation.  The chunk header is tempting as the preceding
 *	region, but mcxt.c expects to able to examine the standard chunk header
 *	fields.  Therefore, we use, when available, the requested_size field and
 *	any subsequent padding.  requested_size is made NOACCESS before returning
 *	a chunk pointer to a caller.  However, to reduce client request traffic,
 *	it is kept DEFINED in chunks on the free list.
 *
 *	The rounded-up capacity of the chunk usually acts as a post-allocation
 *	NOACCESS region.  If the request consumes precisely the entire chunk,
 *	there is no such region; another chunk header may immediately follow.  In
 *	that case, Valgrind will not detect access beyond the end of the chunk.
 *
 *	See also the cooperating Valgrind client requests in mcxt.c.

 * Chunk freelist k holds chunks of size 1 << (k + ALLOC_MINBITS),
 * for k = 0 .. ALLOCSET_NUM_FREELISTS-1.
 *
 * Note that all chunks in the freelists have power-of-2 sizes.  This
 * improves recyclability: we may waste some space, but the wasted space
 * should stay pretty constant as requests are made and released.
 *
 * A request too large for the last freelist is handled by allocating a
 * dedicated block from malloc().  The block still has a block header and
 * chunk header, but when the chunk is freed we'll return the whole block
 * to malloc(), not put it on our freelists.
 *
 * CAUTION: ALLOC_MINBITS must be large enough so that
 * 1<<ALLOC_MINBITS is at least MAXALIGN,
 * or we may fail to align the smallest chunks adequately.
 * 8-byte alignment is enough on all currently known machines.
 *
 * With the current parameters, request sizes up to 8K are treated as chunks,
 * larger requests go into dedicated blocks.  Change ALLOCSET_NUM_FREELISTS
 * to adjust the boundary point; and adjust ALLOCSET_SEPARATE_THRESHOLD in
 * memutils.h to agree.  (Note: in contexts with small maxBlockSize, we may
 * set the allocChunkLimit to less than 8K, so as to avoid space wastage.)
