 * SELECT * FROM wide_table ORDER BY foo, bar, baz.

/*
 * Heap tuple header.  To avoid wasting space, the fields should be
 * laid out in such a way as to avoid structure padding.
 *
 * Datums of composite types (row types) share the same general structure
 * as on-disk tuples, so that the same routines can be used to build and
 * examine them.  However the requirements are slightly different: a Datum
 * does not need any transaction visibility information, and it does need
 * a length word and some embedded type information.  We can achieve this
 * by overlaying the xmin/cmin/xmax/cmax/xvac fields of a heap tuple
 * with the fields needed in the Datum case.  Typically, all tuples built
 * in-memory will be initialized with the Datum fields; but when a tuple is
 * about to be inserted in a table, the transaction fields will be filled,
 * overwriting the datum fields.
 *
 * The overall structure of a heap tuple looks like:
 *			fixed fields (HeapTupleHeaderData struct)
 *			nulls bitmap (if HEAP_HASNULL is set in t_infomask)
 *			alignment padding (as needed to make user data MAXALIGN'd)
 *			object ID (if HEAP_HASOID is set in t_infomask)
 *			user data fields
 *
 * We store five "virtual" fields Xmin, Cmin, Xmax, Cmax, and Xvac in three
 * physical fields.  Xmin and Xmax are always really stored, but Cmin, Cmax
 * and Xvac share a field.  This works because we know that Cmin and Cmax
 * are only interesting for the lifetime of the inserting and deleting
 * transaction respectively.  If a tuple is inserted and deleted in the same
 * transaction, we store a "combo" command id that can be mapped to the real
 * cmin and cmax, but only by use of local state within the originating
 * backend.  See combocid.c for more details.  Meanwhile, Xvac is only set by
 * old-style VACUUM FULL, which does not have any command sub-structure and so
 * does not need either Cmin or Cmax.  (This requires that old-style VACUUM
 * FULL never try to move a tuple whose Cmin or Cmax is still interesting,
 * ie, an insert-in-progress or delete-in-progress tuple.)
 *
 * A word about t_ctid: whenever a new tuple is stored on disk, its t_ctid
 * is initialized with its own TID (location).  If the tuple is ever updated,
 * its t_ctid is changed to point to the replacement version of the tuple.
 * Thus, a tuple is the latest version of its row iff XMAX is invalid or
 * t_ctid points to itself (in which case, if XMAX is valid, the tuple is
 * either locked or deleted).  One can follow the chain of t_ctid links
 * to find the newest version of the row.  Beware however that VACUUM might
 * erase the pointed-to (newer) tuple before erasing the pointing (older)
 * tuple.  Hence, when following a t_ctid link, it is necessary to check
 * to see if the referenced slot is empty or contains an unrelated tuple.
 * Check that the referenced tuple has XMIN equal to the referencing tuple's
 * XMAX to verify that it is actually the descendant version and not an
 * unrelated tuple stored into a slot recently freed by VACUUM.  If either
 * check fails, one may assume that there is no live descendant version.
 *
 * t_ctid is sometimes used to store a speculative insertion token, instead
 * of a real TID.  A speculative token is set on a tuple that's being
 * inserted, until the inserter is sure that it wants to go ahead with the
 * insertion.  Hence a token should only be seen on a tuple with an XMAX
 * that's still in-progress, or invalid/aborted.  The token is replaced with
 * the tuple's real TID when the insertion is confirmed.  One should never
 * see a speculative insertion token while following a chain of t_ctid links,
 * because they are not used on updates, only insertions.
 *
 * Following the fixed header fields, the nulls bitmap is stored (beginning
 * at t_bits).  The bitmap is *not* stored if t_infomask shows that there
 * are no nulls in the tuple.  If an OID field is present (as indicated by
 * t_infomask), then it is stored just before the user data, which begins at
 * the offset shown by t_hoff.  Note that t_hoff must be a multiple of
 * MAXALIGN.
