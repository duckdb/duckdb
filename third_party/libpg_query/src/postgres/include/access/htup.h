/*
 * HeapTupleData is an in-memory data structure that points to a tuple.
 *
 * There are several ways in which this data structure is used:
 *
 * * Pointer to a tuple in a disk buffer: t_data points directly into the
 *	 buffer (which the code had better be holding a pin on, but this is not
 *	 reflected in HeapTupleData itself).
 *
 * * Pointer to nothing: t_data is NULL.  This is used as a failure indication
 *	 in some functions.
 *
 * * Part of a palloc'd tuple: the HeapTupleData itself and the tuple
 *	 form a single palloc'd chunk.  t_data points to the memory location
 *	 immediately following the HeapTupleData struct (at offset HEAPTUPLESIZE).
 *	 This is the output format of heap_form_tuple and related routines.
 *
 * * Separately allocated tuple: t_data points to a palloc'd chunk that
 *	 is not adjacent to the HeapTupleData.  (This case is deprecated since
 *	 it's difficult to tell apart from case #1.  It should be used only in
 *	 limited contexts where the code knows that case #1 will never apply.)
 *
 * * Separately allocated minimal tuple: t_data points MINIMAL_TUPLE_OFFSET
 *	 bytes before the start of a MinimalTuple.  As with the previous case,
 *	 this can't be told apart from case #1 by inspection; code setting up
 *	 or destroying this representation has to know what it's doing.
 *
 * t_len should always be valid, except in the pointer-to-nothing case.
 * t_self and t_tableOid should be valid if the HeapTupleData points to
 * a disk buffer, or if it represents a copy of a tuple on disk.  They
 * should be explicitly set invalid in manufactured tuples.
