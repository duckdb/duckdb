# Parallel HashMap

This directory contains various implementations of hash maps available for use in DuckDB.
It is based on [greg7mdp/parallel-hashmap](greg7mdp/parallel-hashmap) at commit [154c634](https://github.com/greg7mdp/parallel-hashmap/commit/154c63489e84d5569d3b466342a2ae8fd99e4734), with the namespace renamed from `phmap` to `duckdb_phmap`.

Since the library is header-only, there is no need for compilation.
