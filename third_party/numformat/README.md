# Modified OpenOffice number format parser

This directory holds the core number format parser that is used by DuckDB. It is based on the [OpenOffice number format parser](https://github.com/apache/openoffice/tree/trunk/main/svl/source/numbers), but has been stripped down and generally cleaned up to make it easier to modify and extend.
