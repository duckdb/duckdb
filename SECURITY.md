# DuckDB Security Vulnerability Response Policy

Please see the "[Securing DuckDB](https://duckdb.org/docs/current/operations_manual/securing_duckdb/overview)" page first. To quote:
> DuckDB is a powerful analytical database engine. It can read and write files, access the network, load extensions, and use system resources. Like any powerful tool, these capabilities require appropriate configuration when working with sensitive data or in shared environments.

## Security Model

DuckDB is an embedded engine: it runs in the host process, with the privileges of that process. It has no internal privilege boundary and no notion of an untrusted user inside the engine. The embedding application controls which SQL is executed and which files are opened. That is the security boundary, and DuckDB assumes both inputs are trusted.

### SQL

SQL is executable code, comparable to Bash or Python. A query can read and write local files, open network connections, install and load extensions, and consume unbounded CPU, memory and disk. Executing untrusted SQL is therefore unsafe by design, and a query doing any of the above is not a vulnerability.

This also applies to non-SQL APIs: file paths, table names, `ATTACH` targets and filter expressions can all trigger file or network access.

To run untrusted SQL, sandbox at the OS level (container, VM, or [DuckDB-Wasm](https://duckdb.org/docs/stable/clients/wasm/overview)). The settings in [Securing DuckDB](https://duckdb.org/docs/current/operations_manual/securing_duckdb/overview) are defense in depth, not a sandbox, but bypassing them is in scope.

### Data files

Format readers (Parquet, CSV, JSON, Arrow, Avro, Iceberg and Delta metadata, DuckDB database files) assume a well-formed file from a trusted writer. Crafted or corrupted files may crash the process, allocate unbounded memory, or read out of bounds. We fix these as bugs, but do not treat them as vulnerabilities. `ATTACH` on a database file is closer to loading a shared library than to opening a document; the file format is not a security boundary. Do not open data files from untrusted parties.

Data *inside* a well-formed file is a separate case and is in scope. Column values are frequently attacker controlled (user input, scraped text, log lines). Memory corruption, code execution, or unexpected file or network access caused by the values in a file rather than by its structure is a vulnerability, and is prioritized as such.

### Extensions

Loading an extension executes native code in the host process. Core extensions are signed by the DuckDB project; community extensions are third party code. A deliberately loaded malicious extension is not a vulnerability. Loading an extension that was not requested, or loading unsigned code while signature checking is enabled, is.

### In scope

* Memory safety issues (out-of-bounds access, use-after-free) reachable from data values in a well-formed file, or from query execution over trusted input.
* Bypasses of `enable_external_access`, `allowed_directories`, `allowed_paths`, `disabled_filesystems`, `lock_configuration`, the extension settings, or the CLI safe mode.
* Missing or incorrect use of cryptography, e.g. data assumed to be encrypted that is not.
* Sending data to a remote host that was not requested, or exposing secrets that should be redacted.

### Not in scope

* Any effect reachable through untrusted SQL: file access, network access, resource exhaustion.
* Crashes, hangs and out-of-memory on malformed, truncated or crafted data files, including corrupted database files.
* Internal exceptions, assertion failures, and stack overflow on deeply nested input such as expressions or JSON.
* Resource exhaustion by an expensive query.
* Behavior of deliberately loaded third party extensions.

## Supported Versions

Please see our [release calendar](https://duckdb.org/release_calendar) or DuckDB's [`endoflife.date`](https://endoflife.date/duckdb) page to see which versions are currently supported.

## Reporting a Vulnerability
Please check the [Security Model](#security-model) above first: many reports we receive fall outside it.

Please use GitHub's [security reporting tool here](https://github.com/duckdb/duckdb/security/advisories/new) to report a potential security issue. 
Our team will investigate and get back to you. There are three major outcomes of this investigation:

1. The issue is an actual security issue. For [example](https://github.com/duckdb/duckdb/security/advisories/GHSA-vmp8-hg63-v2hp), a return value of a cryptographic function is not checked, and that could lead to failure to encrypt.
1. The issue is a bug, but not really security related. For example, triggering an (internal) exception is generally not considered a security issue.
1. The issue is neither.

If the issue is determined to be an actual security issue, we will request a CVE. For the second case, our [general support policy](https://ducklabs.com/community_support_policy/) will be followed.


## Public Disclosure
We would prefer to only disclose the issue once a DuckDB release is published with a fix. We generally publish a new DuckDB release every few weeks.
Again, see the [release calendar](https://duckdb.org/release_calendar) for the planned release dates.
