This folder contains the source tree of the core of DuckDB. Below is a short overview of the different components.

# Parser
The parser can be found in the [parser](https://github.com/duckdb/duckdb/tree/main/src/parser) folder. This is the entry point for any query that enters DuckDB. DuckDB uses the parser of Postgres ([libpg_query](https://github.com/lfittl/libpg_query)). After parsing the query using that parser, the tokens are transformed into a custom parse tree representation that is based on `SQLStatements`, `Expressions` and `TableRefs`.

# Planner
The planner can be found in the [planner](https://github.com/duckdb/duckdb/tree/main/src/planner) folder. The planner is responsible for taking the tokens extracted from the query string by the `Parser`, and converting them into a Logical Query Plan. The plan is represented as a tree with nodes of type `LogicalOperator`.

# Optimizer
The optimizer can be found in the [optimizer](https://github.com/duckdb/duckdb/tree/main/src/optimizer) folder. The optimizer takes the Logical Query Plan generated by the `Planner` and translates it into a logically equivalent but (hopefully) faster to execute Logical Query Plan. Examples of optimizations that are performed are predicate pushdown, expression rewriting and join ordering. Both cost-based and rule-based optimizations are performed.

# Execution
The execution layer can be found in the [execution](https://github.com/duckdb/duckdb/tree/main/src/execution) folder. The execution layer first takes the Logical Query Plan resulting from the `Optimizer` and converts it into a Physical Query Plan consisting of `PhysicalOperators`. The `PhysicalOperators` are then executed using a push-based execution model.

# Catalog
The catalog management can be found in the [catalog](https://github.com/duckdb/duckdb/tree/main/src/catalog) folder. The catalog keeps track of the the tables, schemas and functions that are contained in the database. The `Catalog` is used by the `Binder` in the planning phase to resolve symbols (e.g. "table_name") to the actual tables and columns that exist in the database.

# Storage
The database storage component can be found in the [storage](https://github.com/duckdb/duckdb/tree/main/src/storage) folder. The storage component is responsible for managing the actual physical data, both as it resides in memory and as it resides on disk. The execution layer uses the storage component whenever it needs to access the base table data (e.g. perform a base table scan) or when it needs to update the information stored in the database (as part of e.g. an `INSERT` or `UPDATE` command).

# Transaction
The transaction management can be found in the [transaction](https://github.com/duckdb/duckdb/tree/main/src/transaction) folder. The transaction manager manages all currently open transactions, and is in charge of handling `COMMIT` or `ROLLBACK` commands.
