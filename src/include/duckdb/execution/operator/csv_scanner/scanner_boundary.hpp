//! We all need boundaries every now and then, CSV Scans also need them
//! This class keeps track of what a scan should read, so which buffer and from where to where
//! As in real life, much like my childhood country, the rules are not really enforced.
//! So the end boundaries of a Scanner Boundary can and will be pushed.
//! In practice this means that a scanner is tolerated to read one line over it's end.
