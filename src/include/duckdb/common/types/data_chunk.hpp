//!  A Data Chunk represents a set of vectors.
/*!
    The data chunk class is the intermediate representation used by the
   execution engine of DuckDB. It effectively represents a subset of a relation.
   It holds a set of vectors that all have the same length.

    DataChunk is initialized using the DataChunk::Initialize function by
   providing it with a vector of TypeIds for the Vector members. By default,
   this function will also allocate a chunk of memory in the DataChunk for the
   vectors and all the vectors will be referencing vectors to the data owned by
   the chunk. The reason for this behavior is that the underlying vectors can
   become referencing vectors to other chunks as well (i.e. in the case an
   operator does not alter the data, such as a Filter operator which only adds a
   selection vector).

    In addition to holding the data of the vectors, the DataChunk also owns the
   selection vector that underlying vectors can point to.
