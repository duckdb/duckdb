//! Memoisation: an (instruction, row) pair that was explored once and led to no match cannot lead to
//! one later, so it is never explored again. That is what keeps the search polynomial where plain
//! backtracking is exponential, and it holds only while the conditions answer the same way each time
//! that pair is reached (see PatternMemo).
//!
//! Under HISTORY they do not, and what is left is cycle detection: a walk may not reach the same
//! instruction twice without matching a row in between, because everything it could do the second
//! time it already did the first. That is a property of the path walked rather than of the search, so
//! the marks live in an undo log - resuming an alternative restores the marks the path that reached
//! it had taken, and matching a row opens a scope the marks left behind cannot answer for.
