//! InterruptMode specifies how operators should block/unblock, note that this will happen transparently to the
//! operator, as the operator only needs to return a BLOCKED result and call the callback using the InterruptState.
//! NO_INTERRUPTS: No blocking mode is specified, an error will be thrown when the operator blocks. Should only be used
//!                when manually calling operators of which is known they will never block.
//! TASK:          A weak pointer to a task is provided. On the callback, this task will be signalled. If the Task has
//!                been deleted, this callback becomes a NOP. This is the preferred way to await blocked pipelines.
//! BLOCKING:	   The caller has blocked awaiting some synchronization primitive to wait for the callback.
