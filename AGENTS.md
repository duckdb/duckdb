# AGENTS.md

This file provides guidance to coding agents when working with code in this repository.

## Overview

DuckDB is a high-performance analytical database system designed to be fast, reliable, portable, and easy to use. It is an analytical database management system with a rich SQL dialect, vectorized execution engine, and columnar storage format.

## Build Commands

### Basic Build
```bash
make debug                   # Builds debug version with sanitizers and assertions
make reldebug                # Builds optimized release version with debug symbols
FORCE_DEBUG=1 make relassert # Builds optimized version with sanitizers and assertions
```

## Testing

### Running Tests
```bash
build/reldebug/test/unittest # Fast unit tests
```

### Running Specific Tests
```bash
# Run specific test file
build/reldebug/test/unittest test/sql/order/test_limit.test

# Run all tests including slow tests
build/reldebug/test/unittest "*"
```

It is recommended to use `make reldebug` and `build/reldebug/test/unittest` unless a good reason exists to use the debug build - the debug build is much slower than the reldebug build.

### Time-Limiting Queries

Use the `max_execution_time` setting (milliseconds, `0` = no limit) to abort a query that runs too long:

```sql
SET max_execution_time=5000;
SELECT count(*) FROM range(100000000) t1, range(1000) t2;
-- INTERRUPT Error: Query exceeded maximum execution time
```

The setting is `LOCAL` by default; use `SET GLOBAL max_execution_time=...` to apply it to all connections. From the shell:

```bash
build/reldebug/duckdb -c "SET max_execution_time=5000; SELECT ..."
```

The deadline is enforced at `ClientContext::InterruptCheck()` call sites, so it only fires once execution reaches one of them. Queries that check in frequently abort close to the limit, but time spent in planning or inside a long non-interruptible stretch is not bounded by it.


### Test File Format
Tests use the sqllogictest format (`.test` files). Example structure:
```sql
# name: test/sql/order/test_limit.test
# description: Test LIMIT keyword
# group: [order]

statement ok
CREATE TABLE test (a INTEGER, b INTEGER);

query I
SELECT a FROM test LIMIT 1
----
11

statement error
SELECT a FROM test LIMIT a
----
<REGEX>:Binder Error:.*not found.*
```

Test directives:
- `statement ok` - Statement should succeed
- `statement error` - Statement should fail
- `query I` - Query returning INTEGER column
- `query II` - Query returning two columns
- `----` - Separates query from expected results
- `<REGEX>:` - Expected error message pattern
- `require-env VAR` - Test requires environment variable

Slow tests should use `.test_slow` extension instead of `.test`.

Do not add `PRAGMA enable_verification` to tests - it should no longer be used in new tests.

## Code Formatting

```bash
make format-fix        # Format all code (clang-format + black)
make generate-files    # Generate files + format all code
```

Ensure you run formatting before committing.

## Extensive Testing / Making CI Work

Below is a set of tests that should be run in order to make sure a changeset passes extensive tests in CI. If the user is asking you to fix CI make sure that the below commands succeed.

```bash
make allunit
FORCE_DEBUG=1 FORCE_ASSERT=1 make reldebug && build/reldebug/test/unittest
make test_configs
make test_vector
```


## Architecture

### Query Execution Pipeline

```
SQL String
    ↓
[PARSER] - Uses a PEG parser to parse SQL into AST
    ↓
SQLStatement tree (ParsedExpression, TableRef objects)
    ↓
[PLANNER/BINDER] - Binds symbols to catalog, creates logical plan
    ↓
Logical Plan (LogicalOperator tree with bound Expressions)
    ↓
[OPTIMIZER] - Applies rule-based and cost-based optimizations
    ↓
Optimized Logical Plan
    ↓
[PHYSICAL PLAN GENERATOR] - Converts to physical operators
    ↓
Physical Plan (PhysicalOperator tree)
    ↓
[EXECUTOR] - Executes with vectorized, parallel pipelines
    ↓
Results
```

### Core Components

**Parser** (`src/parser/`)
- Converts SQL strings to Abstract Syntax Tree (AST)
- Uses a PEG-based parser
- The grammar is located in `*.gram` files and generated using `scripts/build_grammar.sh`
- Outputs: `SQLStatement`, `ParsedExpression`, `TableRef` objects
- Key subdirectories: `expression/`, `statement/`, `tableref/`, `peg/`

For more details on adding new grammar, see the README located at `src/parser/peg/README.md`. 
Each new grammar rule must have a corresponding transformer rule, located at `peg/transformer`.

**Planner** (`src/planner/`)
- Binds symbols to catalog entries and resolves types
- Creates logical query execution plan
- Key classes: `Binder`, `LogicalOperator`, bound `Expression` types
- Subdirectories: `binder/`, `expression/`, `subquery/`

**Optimizer** (`src/optimizer/`)
- Transforms logical plans without changing semantics
- Applies predicate pushdown, join ordering, expression rewriting, etc.
- Subdirectories: `join_order/`, `statistics/`, `rule/`, `pushdown/`

**Execution Engine** (`src/execution/`)
- Converts logical plan to physical plan and executes
- Push-based vectorized execution model
- Processes data in batches (typically 2048 rows)
- Key subdirectories: `operator/` (scan, join, filter, aggregate, etc.), `expression_executor/`

**Storage** (`src/storage/`)
- Manages persistent data storage and buffer management
- Block-based storage with compression
- Includes WAL (Write-Ahead Log) for durability
- Subdirectories: `buffer/`, `compression/`, `checkpoint/`, `table/`

**Catalog** (`src/catalog/`)
- Metadata management for tables, schemas, functions, types, etc.
- Single source of truth for database metadata
- Key classes: `Catalog`, `CatalogEntry`, `SchemaCatalogEntry`

**Transaction Manager** (`src/transaction/`)
- ACID transaction management with MVCC
- Coordinates concurrent access to data
- Key files: `transaction_manager.cpp`, `undo_buffer.cpp`, `wal_write_state.cpp`

**Parallel Execution** (`src/parallel/`)
- Multi-threaded execution with task scheduling
- Pipeline-based parallelism
- Key files: `executor.cpp`, `pipeline_executor.cpp`, `task_scheduler.cpp`

**Functions** (`src/function/`)
- Built-in function implementations
- Types: `scalar/`, `aggregate/`, `table/`, `window/`, `pragma/`

## Extensions

DuckDB supports two types of extensions:

**In-Tree Extensions** (in `extension/` directory):
- Extensions are located in-tree
- Full list in `.github/config/in_tree_extensions.cmake`
- Code can be edited directly and checked into the repository.

**Out-of-Tree Extensions**:
- Extensions are located in a separate git repository
- Full list in `.github/config/out_of_tree_extensions.cmake`
- When changes have to be made, they have to be made in patch files stored in `.github/patches`
- Before adapting an out-of-tree extension, changing its pinned revision, or modifying `.github/patches/extensions`, read and follow `.github/patches/extensions/AGENTS.md`.

Building with extensions:
```bash
# build all extensions
BUILD_ALL_EXT=1 make
# build specific extensions
DUCKDB_EXTENSIONS='json;icu' make
```

## Key Development Patterns

### Data Flow
- **Vectorized Processing**: Data processed in columnar batches (not row-by-row), typically 2048 rows per batch
- **Vector class**: Represents a columnar batch of data
- **ColumnBinding**: Unique identifier `(table_index, column_index)` for columns throughout planning/execution

### Expression Types
- `ParsedExpression` - From parser, unbound
- `Expression` - Bound with type information
- `ExpressionExecutor` - Vectorized execution of expressions

### Memory Management
- Prefer `unique_ptr<T>` for exclusive ownership
- Use `shared_ptr<T>` only when necessary
- `optional_ptr<T>` for nullable references, `reference<T>` for non-nullable references
- Never use raw pointers

### Type System
- `LogicalType` - Abstract data type representation
- Type promotion rules in `src/function/cast_rules.cpp`
- Custom types supported via extension system

### Common Patterns
- **Visitor Pattern**: For tree traversal (e.g., `LogicalOperatorVisitor`, `ExpressionIterator`)
- **Factory Pattern**: `Deserialize()` methods for object creation
- **Class Hierarchy**: Base classes like `*Operator`, `*Entry`, `*Expression` with typed subclasses

## Vector API

Vectors carry their own size, and element access goes through typed iterators (reading) and typed
writers (writing). **The old-style vector loops are deprecated and must not be used in new code:**

```cpp
// DON'T - legacy pattern: ToUnifiedFormat + manual sel/validity indexing
auto idx = vdata.sel->get_index(i);
if (!vdata.validity.RowIsValid(idx)) {
	result_validity.SetInvalid(i);
}
result_data[i] = data[idx] + 1;
```

```cpp
// DO - iterator + writer
auto input_values = input.Values<int64_t>();
auto writer = FlatVector::Writer<int64_t>(result, count);
for (auto entry : input_values) {
	if (!entry.IsValid()) {
		writer.WriteNull();
		continue;
	}
	writer.WriteValue(entry.GetValue() + 1);
}
```

Exceptions: element-wise scalar functions should still use the executors (`UnaryExecutor`,
`BinaryExecutor`, `GenericExecutor`, ...), and type-erased code that does not know the C++ type at
compile time (hash tables, sorting, row layout, storage) still uses `ToUnifiedFormat(data)`.

Headers: `duckdb/common/vector/vector_iterator.hpp`, `duckdb/common/vector/vector_writer.hpp`.

### Reading: `Vector::Values<T>()`

Works on any vector type - never `Flatten()` just to read. Build it once, outside the loop (it
materializes a `UnifiedVectorFormat`), then iterate or index into it. It is not copyable; pass it to
helpers as `const VectorIterator<T> &`.

```cpp
auto values = vec.Values<string_t>();
for (auto entry : values) {   // or: values[i], values.size(), values.CanHaveNull()
	entry.IsValid();          // per-row validity
	entry.GetValue();         // value (asserts validity); GetValueUnsafe() skips the assert
	entry.GetIndex();         // row index
}
```

Also `vec.ValidValues<T>()` (skips NULL rows entirely) and `vec.Validity()` (validity only).

Nested types have iterator specializations, so nested reads need no child/offset arithmetic:

```cpp
// STRUCT(BIGINT, VARCHAR)
auto structs = vec.Values<VectorStructType<int64_t, string_t>>();
for (auto entry : structs) {
	entry.IsValid();                         // top-level struct NULL
	auto a = entry.GetChildValue<0>();       // per-child ValueEntry
	entry.ForEach([&](auto &child) { ... }); // all children in declaration order
}

// LIST(BIGINT) - nests recursively, e.g. VectorListType<VectorListType<double>>
auto lists = vec.Values<VectorListType<int64_t>>();
for (auto entry : lists) {
	entry.GetListLength();
	entry.GetChildValue(idx);
	for (auto child : entry.GetChildValues()) { ... }
}

// VARIANT - traverses shredded and unshredded variants without unshredding
VectorIterator<VectorVariantType> variants(vec);
```

The `VectorListType<T>` iterator does not accept a `DICTIONARY_VECTOR` source - flatten first if the
list vector may be a dictionary.

### Writing: `FlatVector::Writer<T>()`

Writers are push-based: rows are written in order, and the writer sets the result vector's size
itself (no `SetSize` / `SetCardinality` call). Use the `(result, count, offset)` overload to append
at an offset. On destruction the writer asserts that exactly `count` rows were written - call
`Truncate()` if you deliberately write fewer.

```cpp
auto writer = FlatVector::Writer<int64_t>(result, count);
writer.WriteValue(value);
writer.WriteNull();
```

`VectorWriter<string_t>` adds `WriteStringRef(val)` (reference without copying into the vector heap -
keep it alive via `StringVector::AddHeapReference`), `WriteEmptyString(len)` and `GetHeap()`.

Nested writers mirror the iterators:

```cpp
// STRUCT: WriteNull() propagates to every child, keeping the children in sync
auto writer = FlatVector::Writer<VectorStructType<int64_t, string_t>>(result, count);
writer.WriteValue([&](auto &a_writer, auto &b_writer) { ... });
writer.ForEach([&](auto &child_writer) { ... });  // same operation for every child

// LIST, known length per row
for (auto &child_writer : list_writer.WriteList(n)) {
	child_writer.WriteValue(...);
}

// LIST, unknown length - grows on demand, finalized when the returned writer goes out of scope
auto list = list_writer.WriteDynamicList();
list.WriteElement().WriteValue(...);
```

If the element type is not known at compile time, `FlatVector::Writer<list_entry_t>` has a
`WriteDynamicList()` returning a `DynamicListAppender` (`Append(source, sel, ...)` / `AppendNulls`).
For the rare case where rows cannot be written in order, `FlatVector::ScatterWriter<T>(vec)` supports
random access (`writer[idx] = value`, `writer.SetInvalid(idx)`).

## Coding Guidelines (Key Points)

### C++ Style
- Use tabs for indentation, spaces for alignment
- Lines should not exceed 120 columns (run formatter)
- Use `[u]int(8|16|32|64)_t` instead of `int`, `long`, etc.
- Use `idx_t` instead of `size_t` for offsets/indices/counts
- Use `const` references for non-trivial objects
- Use C++11 range-based for loops when possible
- Always use braces for if statements and loops
- Never use `const_cast`

### Comment Conventions

Try to keep comments short. In general, comments should be one short line. Only in exceptional situations should comments be more than one short line. Code should be mostly self-descriptive and too many large comments make code harder to read and understand.

Avoid adding comments specific to how a change was made to the code that relates to a specific issue. For example, a comment like "add +1 to fix an off-by-one error" is not relevant to understanding the code. Such comments related to specific issues that were addressed belong in a PR description or commit message, not in the code itself.

### Naming Conventions
- **Files**: `snake_case` (e.g., `abstract_operator.cpp`)
- **Types**: `PascalCase` (e.g., `LogicalOperator`)
- **Variables**: `snake_case` (e.g., `chunk_size`)
- **Functions**: `PascalCase` (e.g., `GetChunk`)

### Class Layout
```cpp
class MyClass {
public:
    MyClass();
    int my_public_variable;

public:
    void MyFunction();

private:
    void MyPrivateFunction();

private:
    int my_private_variable;
};
```

### Error Handling
- Use exceptions for query-terminating errors (parser error, table not found, out-of-memory, etc.)
- Use return values for errors that are recoverable during a query
- Use `D_ASSERT` for programmer errors (never triggered by user input)
- Assert liberally with clear comments

### Testing Requirements
- Prefer sqllogictest framework (`.test` files) over C++ tests
- Test with different types (numerics, strings, nested types)
- Test unexpected/incorrect usage, not just happy path
- Slow tests should use `.test_slow` extension
- All tests must pass before submitting PR (`make allunit`)
- Aim for high code coverage

## Navigation Tips

### Finding Components
- Entry point: `src/main/database.cpp` (DatabaseInstance)
- Query execution coordinator: `src/main/client_context.cpp`
- SQL parsing: `src/parser/parser.cpp`
- Logical planning: `src/planner/binder/query_planner.cpp`
- Optimization orchestration: `src/optimizer/optimizer.cpp`
- Physical plan generation: `src/execution/physical_plan/physical_plan_generator.cpp`
- Execution orchestration: `src/parallel/executor.cpp`

### Searching the Codebase
- Use `grep` or `ripgrep` for code search
- Function definitions typically in `.cpp` files
- Class declarations in `src/include/duckdb/` headers
- Test cases in `test/sql/` by functionality

### Understanding a Feature
1. Find test cases in `test/sql/` to see usage examples
2. Trace from parser → planner → optimizer → execution
3. Look for corresponding `*Statement`, `*Operator`, `*Expression` classes
4. Check function registration in catalog

### Modifying Generated Files
Some files are auto-generated. After modifying their sources, run:
```bash
make generate-files
```
This regenerates:
- C API bindings
- Function registration
- Settings
- Serialization code
- Storage info
- Metric enums
- Enum utilities
