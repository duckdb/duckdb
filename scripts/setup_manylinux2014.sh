# This script is used to setup the additional dependencies required by duckdb
# for the manylinux2014 image. The reason for this to exist in a script is firstly to be able to
# easily reproduce the same environment locally. Secondly, these steps can be now used
# both in the x86 jobs as the aarch64 jobs on GH actions (aarch64 jobs need a special env).

# Examples
#
### To install just basics:
#
# > scripts/setup_manylinux2014.sh general
#
### Install openssl (through vcpkg, which will be in /tmp/vcpkg), ccache and jdk
#
# > VCPKG_TARGET_DIR=/tmp scripts/setup_manylinux2014.sh general vcpkg openssl ccache jdk
#
