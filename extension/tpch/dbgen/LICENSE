uninterrupted, error-free or free from malicious code. For purposes of
this paragraph, "malicious code" means any program code designed to
contaminate other computer programs or computer data, consume computer

applies to the quality and performance of the Materials. Should the
Materials prove defective, You (and not TPC) assume the entire liability

employers, contractors and agents, and on any successors and assignees.
This Agreement is governed by the laws of the State of California
(except to the extent federal law governs copyrights and trademarks)
without respect to any provisions of California law that would cause
application of the law of another state or country. The parties agree
that the United Nations Convention on Contracts for the International
Sale of Goods will not govern this Agreement. This Agreement is the
entire agreement between us regarding the subject matter hereof and
supersedes any other understandings or agreements with respect to the
Materials or the subject matter hereof. If any provision of this
Agreement is deemed invalid or unenforceable by any court having
jurisdiction, that particular provision will be deemed modified to the
extent necessary to make the provision valid and enforceable, and the

SPECIAL PROVISIONS APPLICABLE TO THE EUROPEAN UNION

If You acquired the Materials in the European Union (EU), the following
provisions also apply to You. If there is any inconsistency between the
terms of the Software License Agreement set out earlier and the
following provisions, the following provisions shall take precedence.

1. Distribution. You may sublicense modifications of the Software
covered in this Agreement if they meet the requirements of clause 9
above.

2. Limited Warranty. EXCEPT AS STATED EARLIER IN THIS AGREEMENT, AND AS
PROVIDED UNDER THE HEADING "STATUTORY RIGHTS", THE SOFTWARE IS PROVIDED
AS-IS WITHOUT WARRANTY OF ANY KIND, EITHER EXPRESS OR IMPLIED,
INCLUDING, BUT NOT LIMITED TO, ANY IMPLIED WARRANTIES, NONINFRINGEMENT,
OR CONDITIONS OF MERCHANTABILITY, QUALITY AND FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR
PURPOSE.

3. Limitation of Remedy and Damages. THE LIMITATIONS OF REMEDIES AND
DAMAGES IN THE SOFTWARE LICENSE AGREEMENT SHALL NOT APPLY TO PERSONAL
INJURY (INCLUDING DEATH) TO ANY PERSON CAUSED BY TPC'S NEGLIGENCE AND
ARE SUBJECT TO THE PROVISION SET OUT UNDER THE HEADING "STATUTORY
RIGHTS".

4. Statutory Rights: Irish law provides that certain conditions and
warranties may be implied in contracts for the sale of goods and in
contracts for the supply of services. Such conditions and warranties are
hereby excluded, to the extent such exclusion, in the context of this
transaction, is lawful under Irish law. Conversely, such conditions and
warranties, insofar as they may not be lawfully excluded, shall apply.
Accordingly nothing in this Agreement shall prejudice any rights that
You may enjoy by virtue of Sections 12, 13, 14 or 15 of the Irish Sale
of Goods Act 1893 (as amended).

5. General. This Agreement is governed by the laws of the Republic of
Ireland. The local language version of this agreement shall apply to

between us with respect to the subject matter hereof and You agree that

representation made by it, its agents or anyone else (whether innocently
or negligently) upon which You relied upon entering this Agreement,
unless such untrue statement or representation was made fraudulently.
