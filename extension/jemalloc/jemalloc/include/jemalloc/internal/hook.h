/*
 * This API is *extremely* experimental, and may get ripped out, changed in API-
 * and ABI-incompatible ways, be insufficiently or incorrectly documented, etc.
 *
 * It allows hooking the stateful parts of the API to see changes as they
 * happen.
 *
 * Allocation hooks are called after the allocation is done, free hooks are
 * called before the free is done, and expand hooks are called after the
 * allocation is expanded.
 *
 * For realloc and rallocx, if the expansion happens in place, the expansion
 * hook is called.  If it is moved, then the alloc hook is called on the new
 * location, and then the free hook is called on the old location (i.e. both
 * hooks are invoked in between the alloc and the dalloc).
 *
 * If we return NULL from OOM, then usize might not be trustworthy.  Calling
 * realloc(NULL, size) only calls the alloc hook, and calling realloc(ptr, 0)
 * only calls the free hook.  (Calling realloc(NULL, 0) is treated as malloc(0),
 * and only calls the alloc hook).
 *
 * Reentrancy:
 *   Reentrancy is guarded against from within the hook implementation.  If you
 *   call allocator functions from within a hook, the hooks will not be invoked
 *   again.
 * Threading:
 *   The installation of a hook synchronizes with all its uses.  If you can
 *   prove the installation of a hook happens-before a jemalloc entry point,
 *   then the hook will get invoked (unless there's a racing removal).
 *
 *   Hook insertion appears to be atomic at a per-thread level (i.e. if a thread
 *   allocates and has the alloc hook invoked, then a subsequent free on the
 *   same thread will also have the free hook invoked).
 *
 *   The *removal* of a hook does *not* block until all threads are done with
 *   the hook.  Hook authors have to be resilient to this, and need some
 *   out-of-band mechanism for cleaning up any dynamically allocated memory
 *   associated with their hook.
 * Ordering:
 *   Order of hook execution is unspecified, and may be different than insertion
 *   order.
