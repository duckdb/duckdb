Thanks for opening this issue in the DuckDB issue tracker! To resolve this issue, our team needs a reproducible example. This includes:

* A source code snippet which reproduces the issue.
    * The snippet should be self-contained, i.e., it should contain all imports and should use relative paths instead of hard coded paths (please avoid `/Users/JohnDoe/...`).
    * A lot of issues can be reproduced with plain SQL code executed in the [DuckDB command line client](https://duckdb.org/docs/api/cli/overview). If you can provide such an example, it greatly simplifies the reproduction process and likely results in a faster fix.
* If the script needs additional data, please share the data as a CSV, JSON, or Parquet file. Unfortuantely, we cannot fix issues that can only be reproduced with a confidential data set. [Support contracts](https://duckdblabs.com/#support) allow sharing confidential data with the core DuckDB team under NDA.
